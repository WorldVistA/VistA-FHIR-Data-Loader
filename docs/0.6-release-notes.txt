VistA FHIR Data Loader v0.6

The main change done in this version is to support the import of lab panels.

The following panels in Synthea are supported:

- Urinalysis macro (dipstick) panel - Urine 24357-6 (Leukocyte Estrase and
  Nitrates import as labs since they are not part of the panel in VEHU; Urine
  Appearance is not importable as that's not in VEHU; Bacteria Culture in Urine
  is not importable as that's Micro and we don't support Micro importing)
- Basic metabolic panel - Blood 51990-0 (full mapping)
- Lipid panel with direct LDL - Serum or Plasma 57698-3 (full mapping)
- Basic metabolic 2000 panel - Serum or Plasma 24321-2 (full mapping)
- Comprehensive metabolic 2000 panel - Serum or Plasma 24323-8 (CO2, AST, COMPUTED CREATININE CLEARANCE import as labs since they are not part of CMP in VEHU)
- CBC panel - Blood by Automated count 58410-2 (PDW imports as a lab, since it's not part of CBC in VEHU)
- Troponin I.cardiac panel - Serum or Plasma by High sensitivity method 89577-1 (lab imports, not panel)
- Iron panel - Serum or Plasma 75689-0 (Ferritin [only lab] imports; not panel)
- Iron and Iron binding capacity panel - Serum or Plasma 50190-8 (full mapping)
- PT panel - Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay 34528-0 (PT only; PTT is not part of the panel in Synthea; INR is not part of the panel in VistA)
- Urinalysis complete panel - Urine 24356-8 (full mapping)

All together, this covers about 94% of the Panels generated by Synthea,
although in reality the import percentage is lower mainly due to duplicated
labs. This is a bug in Synthea, and a report was filed at
https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/issues/1552.

The import algorithm works as follows: first load the panels; if a lab in a
panel is not part of the definition of the panel in VistA, then skip that lab.
If the panel files successfully, then mark their component labs as filed
successfully; otherwise, keep the labs unmarked so that they can be tried
individually later. Next, all labs that either a. were not part of a panel; b.
were part of a panel but were not part of the VistA definition of the panel;
and c. were part of a panel that failed to file, are now attempted to be filed
into VistA.

Besides this major feature, here are the other changes done in this release:

- Removing rounding of lab results because the VistA DataLoader went into an
  infinite loop when a lab had a number of decimals that it didn't expect. This
  is fixed as part of VistA DataLoader v3.1, which is a dependency of the new version
  of the VistA FHIR Data Loader.
- Don't try to file calculated labs; just count them as successful. Currently this
  applies only to `Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate LOINC: 33914-3`.
- Update `SYNINIT` to suppress "Late ACRP Related Bulletins"; otherwise you will get
  lots of emails regarding old encounters that Synthea files.
- Update message "already loaded" in SYNFHIR to contain filename.
- Test patients already loaded just by checking the filename; previously, we
  had to import the JSON and analyze it before deciding that the patient was
  already imported. The new check is much faster.
- Comment out any debugging ZWRITE calls
- Remove all code that uses unknown URLs
	- There was a lot of code that syncs data between systems; or points
	to dead terminology servers. All such code while potentially useful
	can open us to security issues in case the domains are taken over.
	- SYNFPUL, SYNFVF, SYNSYNCH entire routines removed.
	- Code in SYNF{ALG,APT,MED2} that pointed to SYNFPUL has now been
	removed.
	- SYNDHPMP did a lot of terminology lookups on a now defunct server. We
	don't support remote server terminology lookups, and all that code has
	now been removed. The defunct servers used to be owned by a previous
	sponsor of the project.
	- Here's a list of the remaining URLs in code (not in comments) in the project:
	    - SYNFPAT: `set ssnref="http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ssn"`. Used as
	      a variable, never used in a URL.
	    - SYNFMED: `N URL S URL="https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/REST/rxcui/{RXN}/property.json?propName=VUID"`.
	      Well known API for RxNorm API. A future version of the project
	      may use this.
- Convert usages of SYNJSON to XLFJSON. The original project used the VPR JSON
  encoder/decoder prior to it making it into the official VA Kernel; now that it is
  in the VA Kernel, use that rather than carry a copy of the encoder/decoder.
- Suppress talking from Fileman by setting DIQUIET (happens when filing
  Encounters and Procedures)
- Make new users for Synthea not login users by removing setting of
  Verify codes (Access Codes still needed in order to ensure Mailman and
  other parts of VistA still function).
- Remove new users for Synthea from Intro message
- Counters for labs and panels are initialized to zero so that the report will
  contain a positive affirmation of the actual number of panels/labs that
  loaded/failed. This has not been done for the other domains yet.
- Check for XUMGR before KIDS starts installation in ENV and
  Pre-install.
- Since we now don't expect to use our new users as login users, check
  for LRLAB and LRVERIFY keys before starting patient loads. If these
  are not present, don't start load.
- Rollover lab accession numbers by default. It's a no-op if it is not
  needed. This suppresses error messages from the lab package in case
  rollover is not done on a nightly basis in Taskman.
- Add a way (now the default) to import only one patient at a time.
  Importing multiple patients, while useful for a batch operation,
  results in our inability to terminate the import early. You can still
  import multiple patients if you want.
- When importing patients:
    - Remember previous directory
    - Pick next unloaded patient by default
- Code cleanup in SYNKIDS
    - Move ^SYNINIT to be under POST
    - Reorganize tags to be in the order they are called
    - Removed unused tags
- Remove remnants of the code that used the M Web Server. Originally, this
  project used a Web Server embedded in VistA to receive patients from
  Synthea; this Web Server is not available in the VA, and so its usage was
  dropped. There were still lines here and there that were not used--they were
  removed.
