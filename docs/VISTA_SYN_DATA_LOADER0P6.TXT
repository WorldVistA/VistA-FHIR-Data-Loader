Description:
============
This project lets you load data from Synthea (https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) 
into VistA to produce high quality synthetic patient data for development and testing.
Other FHIR data sources are supportable; but are not supported at this time.

DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. This software is only used to
create patients on test VistA systems.

This software was only tested on VEHU systems. FOIA VistAs (completely empty)
may work, but need to be tested first.

The code is located at the Github repo at https://github.com/WorldVistA/VistA-FHIR-Data-Loader

Detailed Install and Usage instructions can be found at the README.md in the Github repo.

 The BEST way to be able to rollback is to have a back-up of your VistA instance;
 once you start importing patients, its impossible to undo the import of patients.

 To remove the software:
  - DISUSER users:
  	- PROVIDER,UNKNOWN SYNTHEA
	- PHARMACIST,UNKNOWN SYNTHEA
  - To remove the sofware:
  	- Delete all routines SYN*
  	- Delete all OPTIONs SYN*
  - Delete file GRAPH (2002.801)
